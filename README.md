# Data-Structure and Algorithm

Data Structure and Algorithms are important part of computer science.They form the fundamental building blocks of developing
logical solutions to problems. They help in creating efficient programs that perform tasks optimally.

-A Data-Structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. 

-General data structure types include arrays,files,linked lists,stacks,queues,Trees,graphs and so on.

-Depending on the organisation of the elements,data structures are classified into two types:
    
      1.> Linear data structure: Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store
          all element sequentially.
          Examples: Linked Lists,Stack and Queues.
          
      2.> Non Linear data structure: Elements of these data structure are stored/accessed in a non-linear order.
          Examples: Trees and Graphs.
